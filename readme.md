nqueens-kotlin-optaplanner
==========================

A toy project demonstrating how to solve the [N Queens puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) using
Kotlin with the popular open source Java-based [OptaPlanner](https://www.optaplanner.org/) constraint solver and the
[Drools](http://drools.org/) rule engine.

This code is meant to be used for demonstration and learning purposes; multicore, parallel and even polynomial time
solutions [0] are readily available elsewhere.
